How to get started with Business Acumen for Data Science?

Hi! Another day of sharing and having fun :). So now I really want to talk about business acumen.

The "official" definition of business acumen is keenness and speed in understanding and deciding on a business situation.

So what does it have to do with Data Science? Actually everything.

Data Science as several authorities in the area have said (take a look at Kirk Borne), is a position more closer to the business than to IT, and I've discussed this statement widely here.

Last week in the Data Science Office Hours we talked about the importance of understanding and defining a problem in DS. The first step here is understanding the business.

Understanding a business and develop this "business acumen" is crucial for a Data Scientist. So here I list some courses and blogs to get started with this:

1. Pluralsight:
